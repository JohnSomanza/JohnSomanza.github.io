In this project, we will utilize Qualys, a cloud-based service for vulnerability scanning and management, to conduct thorough scans on a Windows virtual machine. Initially, we will install outdated versions of VLC Media Player and Firefox to simulate common security oversights. Additionally, we will modify firewall settings and edit the Windows registry to further expose vulnerabilities within the virtual machine. Following this, we will perform vulnerability scans with Qualys before and after implementing remediation measures, allowing us to assess the impact of updates and security improvements.
